<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="callisto">"What is Callisto?"</h3>
<p>It's a build tool that manages your project and does all the usual romhacking things through a simple user interface with a few actions. Callisto designed to run tools only when needed and avoid potential conflicts between resources, this way it insures your hack is cleanly constructed whenever you make changes. The big upside of using this is if something goes wrong then you can easily pinpoint what that was and remove or fix it so the next time you build it is not included in your project.</p>
<p>See the Callisto readmes in the <a href="../">docs</a> folder for more details information about how to use this tool.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="lunar-helper">"What happened to Lunar Helper?"</h3>
<p>Lunar Helper has been succeeded by Callisto, which is detailed above. Callisto functions in much the same way as Lunar Helper, as a tool that handles all other tools controlled with simple commands, but it was rebuilt to be having better cross-platform support and improved performance.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="build-scripts">"What happened to the build scripts?"</h3>
<p>In an effort to keep the baserom lean, we're going all-in on the Callisto build tool. The build batch files, while useful, were also a bit of maintainance burden and didn't work for some people.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="no-bps">"Where is the BPS patch to use the baserom?"</h3>
<p>To get people familiar with the build process of the baserom we've opted to not include the BPS patch to create a ready-to-use baserom. The very simple initialization steps will create a clean slate to get started on a project. If you are in need of a BPS file, Callisto can create one with the <code>Package</code> action, or from a button on the included <a href="User Toolbar.html">User Toolbar</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="removing-things">"How do I remove things from the baserom?"</h3>
<p>Callisto makes it easy to remove items from the baserom without a problem as it re-builds your ROM from scratch avoiding resource conflicts.</p><p> Removing resources, like blocks, sprites, music, etc., follows the usual process for each tool, <b>but</b> you simply run an <code>Update</code> action from Callisto instead of running the tool itself.</p><p>Removing patches is also relatively straightforward, you can remove them from the <code>[patches]</code> section of <a href="../../buildtool/resources.toml">resources.toml</a> in the buildtool folder, and also run an <code>Update</code> action in Callisto.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="hide-statusbar">"How do I hide the status bar?"</h3>
<p>This baserom comes with several objects to toggle features in levels, including one to hide the status bar. Check out the <a href="UberASM Objects.html">UberASM Objects</a> documentation for details.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="fast-retry">"Does this have Fast Retry?"</h3>
<p>Yes! By default the baserom is configured to be "vanilla" but you can turn on the retry in a level using a custom object. The <a href="UberASM Objects.html#retry-objects">UberASM Objects</a> has a section for the retry system with details. Otherwise you can make hack-wide changes to the retry system, by editing its config files in <code>tools/uberasmtool/retry_config</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="block-graphics">"Why are my block graphics not looking right?"</h3>
<center><img src="img/garbled_map16.png" title="Custom block tiles missing ExGraphics"></center>
<p>Many of the custom global block in the baserom use ExGraphics, loading <code>E17</code> into the <b>FG2</b> slot in the Super GFX Bypass dialog will make the blocks appear as they are intended to in other levels.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="sa1">"Is the baserom SA-1 compatible?"</h3>
<p>Yes! The baserom's resources are all compatible with SA-1, but the baserom itself is configured to be FastROM by default. However to use SA-1 it only takes a couple steps to switch over to it:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the "project.toml" file in the <b>buildtool</b> folder, change the <code>initial_patch</code> setting to use the SA-1 option.</li>
<li>Rebuild your project in Callisto to make the change.</li>
</ol>

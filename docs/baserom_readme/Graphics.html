<p>The baserom remaps a bunch of sprites and shuffles some graphics around to fit in some useful sprite and block resources. Below is a breakdown of all of the graphical modifications made to the Vanilla game, if you are interested in seeing what those changes are or want to revert them.</p>

<h3 id="remapped-graphics">Remapped Graphics</h3>
<p>In resources that formerly contained tiles for remapped sprites (namely the lava splash tiles, Yoshi tongue tiles, and the ON/OFF bounce sprite tiles) there will be placeholder graphics in the freed-up space.</p>
<div class="flex">
    <center><code>GFX03</code><img src="img/edited_GFX03.png"></center>

</div>
<p>Unedited versions of these resources can be found in the <code>resources/original_graphics</code> folder.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="exgraphics">ExGraphics</h3>
<h4 id="edited_ExGFX">ExGFXB54: ExGraphic Version of Big Bush and Pipe (BG2)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Contains optional tiles for the big bushes and big pipe that can be used as ExGraphics, as well as some alternative pipe corner tiles.</li>

<hr>
<h3 id="alt-exgfx">Alternate ExGraphics</h3>
<p>Lunar Magic supports a special sort of ExGraphic called "Alternate ExGFX" which is used for ExAnimation to store frames that are globally available in the ROM (opposed to slot AN2, which is per-level). The baserom stores some frame data to <code>ExGFX61</code>.</p>
<h4 id="edited_ExGFX">ExGFX61: Global ExAnimation</h4>
<p>In the baserom the <code>ExGFX61</code> resource contains all global animation frames, for ON/OFF tiles, one-Ways, the sprite note block, etc. See the <a href="ExAnimation.html">Exanimation</a> page for more details on how they're used. However there are some extra frames available for additional use.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="palettes">Palettes</h3>
<p>For the most part the baserom doesn't touch the palettes of the Vanilla game, however the palette row for the Pink Berry (object 1E) has been changed to row <code>5</code> from row <code>3</code> so it will appear blank in Lunar Magic.</p>
<center><img src="img/pink-berry-palette.png"></center>
<p>This change was made to make some room for some a global colors in the Shared palette that is used by graphics for some of the custom blocks in the baserom.</p>
<center><img width="288" src="img/edited_shared-palette.png"></center>
<h4 id="pink-berry">Pink Berry</h4>
<p>The original Pink Berry's palette can be restored if you import the <code>resources/palettes/PinkBerry.pal</code> file, should you end up using them in your level(s).</p>
<center><img width="288" src="img/pink-berry-imported-palette.png"></center>
<h4 id="poison-mushroom">Poison Mushroom</h4>
<p>The Poison mushroom is the only sprite in the baserom using a custom palette&ndash;palette row <code>A</code> for the hurt mushroom and row <code>B</code> for the kill variety&ndash;you can import it from <code>resources/palettes/PoisonMushroom.pal</code> to use in your level(s).</p>
<center><img width="288" src="img/poison-mushroom-palette.png"></center>
<h4 id="custom-blocks">Custom Blocks</h4>
<p>If you happen to overwrite or lose the palette for the custom blocks mentioned above, you can re-import it from <code>resources/palettes/CustomBlocks.pal</code> to use in your level(s).</p>

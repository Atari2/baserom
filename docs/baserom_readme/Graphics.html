<h3 id="remapped-graphics">Remapped Graphics</h3>
<p>In resources that formerly contained tiles for remapped sprites (namely the lava splash tiles, Yoshi tongue tiles, and the ON/OFF bounce sprite tiles) there will be placeholder graphics in the freed-up space.</p>
<div class="flex">
    <center><code>GFX03</code><img src="img/edited_GFX03.png"></center>
    <center><code>GFX04</code><img src="img/edited_GFX04.png"></center>
    <center><code>GFX05</code><img src="img/edited_GFX05.png"></center>

    <center><code>GFX0D</code><img src="img/edited_GFX0D.png"></center>

<h3 id="alt-exgfx">Alternate ExGraphics</h3>
<p>Lunar Magic supports a special sort of ExGraphic called "Alternate ExGFX" which is used for ExAnimation to store frames that are globally available in the ROM (opposed to slot AN2, which is per-level). The baserom stores some frame data to <code>ExGFX61</code>.</p>
<h4 id="edited_ExGFX">ExGFX61: Global ExAnimation</h4>
<p>In the baserom the <code>ExGFX61</code> resource contains all global animation frames, for ON/OFF tiles, one-Ways, the sprite note block, etc. See the <a href="ExAnimation.html">Exanimation</a> page for more details on how they're used. However there are some extra frames available for additional use.</p>

<p>The baserom uses a framework of custom objects to allow you to toggle or activate some simple UberASM codes that are in the baserom, most of which are very basic utility features. They are activated simply by inserting a custom extension object into whichever levels you want with no limit. These objects work alongside any level UberASM you may want to use as well.</p>

<h3 id="inserting-objects">Inserting Custom Objects</h3>
<p>To insert a custom UberASM object, make note of the custom ID value from the tables above.</p>
<p>Next, open the "Add Object Manual (hex)" window, either from the "Edit &rarr; Insert manual..." menu action, or by pressing the <span class="key">Insert</span class="key"> key while in Lunar Magic's "Layer 1 editing" mode.</p>
<p>In this window type the ID value for the UberASM Object into the "Size/Type/Ext (0-FF)" field, and press "OK" to insert.</p>
<center><img src="img/insert_object_manual.png" alt="Lunar Magic's Add Object Manual (hex) Window" title="Lunar Magic's Add Object Manual (hex) Window"></center>
<p>When inserted, custom objects will look like a pair of garbage tiles in Lunar Magic since they load a "null" object, but these objects won't actually appear in game. An object may occasionally use an exit-enabled (door) tile which may display a warning depending on your Lunar Magic settings.</p>

<p>Multiple custom UberASM objects can be inserted and active in one level by repeating the steps above for each object.</p>

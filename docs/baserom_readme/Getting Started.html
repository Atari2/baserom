<h3 id="clean-rom">Provide a Clean Super Mario World ROM</h2>
<p>First things first, you'll need to provide a copy of a clean, headered<sup>1</sup> Super Mario World ROM (USA version) renamed to <code>clean.smc</code> and placed in the "resources" folder so it can be found by the build tool. Take care to ensure the file extension* is <code>.smc</code> and not <code>.sfc</code>.</p>
<p class="infobox">It is important to do this step otherwise you can't get started.</p>
<small>*this may require you to turn on extensions in Windows' File Explorer.</small>
<p><sup>1</sup>If your rom does not have a header&ndash;which you will notice because tools will be unable to work with it&ndash;open it in Lunar Magic and you will be prompted to add a header. Hit "OK" after being prompted but <b>DO NOT SAVE</b> the rom.</p>
<h3 id="initialize-the-baserom">Initialize the Baserom</h3>
<p>To start using the baserom you will first have to initialize the project as it comes without any of the tools bundled. You can do this by running the provided script: <code>!initialize_baserom.bat</code>. In Windows, this can be done by double clicking on it in File Explorer, or executing it from a Terminal or the Command Line.</p>
<p>The script will launch a new command line window where you will see the following menu.</p>

-----------------------------------
RHR Baserom (v5.0) - Initialization
-----------------------------------

Welcome! To get started with the baserom, run both of the following steps:

1. Download and set up all baserom tools
2. Run first build of the Baserom
0. Exit

Enter the number of your choice
</pre>
<p>Both actions above <b>are required</b> during set up to make sure things are all good to go.</p>
<h4>Step 1 - Download and Setup all Baserom Tools</h4>
<p>This action will check for all of the tools required by the baserom, and download them on demand. This is done to keep the baserom pretty lean and avoid distributing a lot of executables and binary files.</p>
<h4>Step 2 - Run first build of the Baserom</h4>
<p>This step will build the baserom from scratch using Callisto so you can get right to hacking on your project.</p>
<p class="infobox">If this fails, run Callisto manually from the "buildtool" folder so you can see what went wrong.</p>
<p>If everything has been set-up correctly, and the first build was successfull, the baserom is ready for use. If you have further questions you can read the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> or <a href="Basics.html">Basics</a> pages or visit the <code>#baserom-support</code> in the Romhack Races Discord server.</p>

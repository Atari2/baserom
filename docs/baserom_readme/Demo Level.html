<h2>Demo Level</h2>
<p>The baserom has a demo level inserted into <code>105</code> so it's seen right when you open Lunar Magic. This level is normally Yoshi's Island 1 but that has been moved to the unused level <code>112</code>.</p>
<p>The demo level is designed to present the some of custom resources included in the baserom, display a block legend, and give short bits of advice for constructing your level.</p>
<p>You can see an image capture of the level below but it is also playable and accessible on the Overworld on a path that goes up from Yoshi's House so you can try it for yourself.</p>

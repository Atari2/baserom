<h3 id="resource-credits">Resource Credits</h3>
<p>It is good practice to keep track of resources you use in your project as you work on your hack, both so you know what you've included and as a helpful to way to credit the authors of resources when you go to release your hack. Especially if you intend to submit it to SMW Central which requires some form of credits alongside submissions (if not included in them).</p>
<p>See the included "CREDITS.txt" file in this baserom as an example, which is provided for your convenience.</p>
<p class="infobox">This project has no license nor do the maintainers claim any rights to the resources included in this project, those remain the rights of their respective authors.</p>
